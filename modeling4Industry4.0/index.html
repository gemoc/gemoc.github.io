       <h1 id="industry-40-systematic-mapping-study">Industry 4.0 Systematic Mapping Study</h1>

<p>Industrial revolutions always introduced step changes to manufacturing. The
first industrial revolution (18th to 19th century) advanced production from
manual to machine-driven manufacturing, introduced factories, and enabled
leveraging steam power for production. The second industrial
revolution (1870 to 1914) introduced electric power to enable mass
production of goods using the concept of interchangeable parts.
The third industrial revolution (ca. 1980 to 2010) describes the transition
from analog to digital (mostly isolated) production systems.  Industry 4.0 is the fourth industrial evolution focusing on integrating digitized cyber-physical production systems with processes and stakeholders to optimize the complete value-added chain. 
Originally, it has been announced as part of the
high-tech strategy of the German Federal Ministry for Education and
Research. However, the essence of Industry 4.0 has become an
international phenomenon as the Japanese Industrial Value Chain
Initiative, the Advanced Manufacturing Initiative in the United
States, the Chinese Made in China 2025 strategy,
Manufacturing 3.0 in South Korea, and the national
Catapult research center on High Value Manufacturing in the
United Kingdom indicate.</p>

<p>Industry 4.0 is a term coined 2011 at Hannover fair as the fourth 
industrial revolution that arises from interconecting all parts of the 
manufacturing value-added chain. It also has become the title of a 
<a href="https://www.bmbf.de/de/zukunftsprojekt-industrie-4-0-848.htm]">high tech strategy project of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research</a> 
and can be defined as</p>
<ul>
  <li>“the next phase in the digitization of the manufacturing sector, driven by four disruptions: […] data volumes, computational power, and connectivity; the emergence of analytics and business-intelligence capabilities; new forms of human-machine interaction […]; and improvements in transferring digital instructions to the physical world, such as advanced robotics and 3-D printing.” (<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/manufacturings-next-act">McKinsey</a>) or</li>
  <li>“connected, intelligent products that communicate with users, new digital business models that harness collected data to offer additional services and as-a-service products, products on the assembly line that tell shop floor machinery how they are to be processed. The core of Industry 4.0 is highly intelligent connected systems that create a fully digital value chain, the 4th industrial revolution enabled by the Industrial Internet of Things.” (<a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/digital-industry-index">Accenture</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>This “fourth industrial revolution” raises new challenges for future
manufacturing which are driven by four disruptions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>data volumes, computational power, and connectivity;</li>
  <li>the emergence of analytics and business-intelligence capabilities;</li>
  <li>new forms of human-machine interaction;</li>
  <li>and improvements in transferring digital instructions to the 
physical world, such as advanced robotics and 3D printing.</li>
</ul>

<p>We conducted a systematic mapping study to uncover how modeling in a broad sense, i.e., leveraging techniques from software engineering, to artificial intelligence, to formal methods,  is applied tackle these challenges. This website accompanies the study including data until February 2017 and its update comprising publications until Feburary 2018.</p>

<h1 id="2017-mapping-study">2017 Mapping Study</h1>

<p>Adopting a detailed search strategy over multiple digital 
libraries, 1466 papers – published until February 2017 – were initially 
identified as possibly relevant. Of these, 222 papers were selected and 
categorized using a particular classification scheme. In the study, we 
present the concerns addressed by modeling community for Industry 4.0, how 
these are investigated, where these are published, and by whom. The 
resulting research landscape can help to understand, guide, and compare 
research in this field. In particular, this paper identifies the 
Industry 4.0 challenges addressed  by the modeling community but also the 
challenges that seems to be less investigated.</p>

<p>For better transparency and replicability, this website provides</p>

<ul>
  <li>a list of the <a href="./data/2017-corpus.xlsx">initial 1466 publications</a> and</li>
  <li>a <a href="./data/2017-included.xlsx">sanitized list of the 222 included publications</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>We hope that this data supports better comprehension of the systematic mapping study and of its results.</p>

  <li>We also provide its <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01514421v2">open access preprint</a> for your convenience.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="2019-mapping-study-update">2019 Mapping Study Update</h1>

<p>We updated the study to include results until Feburary 2018. For this update, 
we investigated 2998 additional publications out of which 186 additional publications were included into the mapping study. Below you find the updated data sets:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a list of the <a href="./data/2018-corpus.xlsx">initial 4404 publications</a> and</li>
  <li>a <a href="./data/2018-included.xlsx">sanitized list of the total 408 included publications</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="search-process">Search Process</h1>

<p>To prevent limiting your data collection on only specific modeling techniques
applied in Industry 4.0, we developed the following query, consisting of 
of terms related to manufacturing of Industry 4.0 and the objects of modeling research.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">("digital factory" OR "digital factories"
  OR "smart factory" OR "smart factories"
  OR "factory of the future" OR "factories of the future" 
  OR "Industry 4.0") 
AND 
  ("metamodel" OR "DSL" OR "UML" OR "domain-specific language" 
  OR "modeling language" OR "modelling language")</code></p>

<p>Essentially, this is a conjunction of two disjunctions: The first part of the conjunction captures terms related to Industry 4.0. The second part captures terms representing the objects of modeling research. As we conducted a full-text search with this clause, we omitted including synonyms for “DSL” or “modeling language”. Papers contributing to modeling should at least use these terms in either related work or the referenced literature. Although we cannot exclude omitting a small number of possibly relevant publications that do not provide such discussions, searching this way yields better results than just searching titles and abstracts. Moreover, we also did not enforce any inferior year-limit and included papers published until February 2018. Where such complex logical conditions were not supported, we searched for parts of the query and joined the results manually. For ACM Digital Library we could reuse the query as is (modulo minor changes to its concrete syntax). For Google Scholar we used its advanced search mode to separate to split the query into five queries, each containing one exact phrase of the modeling terms (i.e., “modeling language”, “metamodel”, etc.) and at least one of the domain terms (i.e., “Industry 4.0”, “digital factory”, etc.). We extracted the results using Harzing’s Publish or Perish software to extract results. Due to its limitation to ca. 1.000 citations per query, we downloaded the citations in multiple parts using inferior and superior year limits. We manually merged the resulting lists of citations and removed the Scholar-internal duplicates obtained by our process manually. Through this, we aim to minimize the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24160679">issues of using Google Scholar for structured literature retrieval</a> (e.g., non-commutativity of logical disjunctions) while benefiting from its wealth of provided publications.
IEEE Xplore enforces a limit of 40 search terms, which did not affect our query and supports the use of nested Boolean queries through its advanced search, hence data retrieval was straightforward. Similarly, retrieving citations from Scopus, SpringerLink, and Web of Science did not require any changes to the query as all three libraries support nested Boolean queries through their advanced search.</p>

<p>Although we cannot exclude omitting a small number of possibly relevant publications that do not provide such discussions, searching this way yields better results than just searching titles and abstracts. Moreover, we also did not enforce any inferior year-limit and included papers published until February 2018. Where such complex logical conditions were not supported, we searched for parts of the query and joined the results manually. For ACM Digital Library we could reuse the query as is (modulo minor changes to its concrete syntax). For Google Scholar we changed the representation of the query’s Boolean operators and used <a href="https://harzing.com/resources/publish-or-perish}">Harzing’s Publish or Perish</a> software to extract  results. Due to its limitation to ca. 1.000 citations per query, we downloaded the citations in two parts out of which one includes citations until $2017$ and the other all later citations. IEEE Xplore enforces a limit of 40 search terms, which did not affect our query and supports the use of nested Boolean queries through its advanced search, hence data retrieval was straightforward. Similarly, retrieving citations from Scopus, SpringerLink, and Web of Science did not require any changes to the query as both supports nested Boolean queries through their advanced search.
