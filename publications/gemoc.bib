title="Advanced and efficient execution trace management for executable domain-specific modeling languages",
journal="Software {\&} Systems Modeling",

day="16",
abstract="Executable Domain-Specific Modeling Languages (xDSMLs) enable the application of early dynamic verification and validation (V{\&}V) techniques for behavioral models. At the core of such techniques, execution traces are used to represent the evolution of models during their execution. In order to construct execution traces for any xDSML, generic trace metamodels can be used. Yet, regarding trace manipulations, generic trace metamodels lack efficiency in time because of their sequential structure, efficiency in memory because they capture superfluous data, and usability because of their conceptual gap with the considered xDSML. Our contribution is a novel generative approach that defines a multidimensional and domain-specific trace metamodel enabling the construction and manipulation of execution traces for models conforming to a given xDSML. Efficiency in time is improved by providing a variety of navigation paths within traces, while usability and memory are improved by narrowing the scope of trace metamodels to fit the considered xDSML. We evaluated our approach by generating a trace metamodel for fUML and using it for semantic differencing, which is an important V{\&}V technique in the realm of model evolution. Results show a significant performance improvement and simplification of the semantic differencing rules as compared to the usage of a generic trace metamodel.",

    abstract = {{The engineering of systems involves many different stakeholders, each with their own domain of expertise. Hence more and more organizations are adopting Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) to allow domain experts to express solutions directly in terms of relevant domain concepts. This new trend raises new challenges about designing DSLs, evolving a set of DSLs and coordinating the use of multiple DSLs for both DSL designers and DSL users. This paper explores various dimensions of these challenges, and outlines a possible research roadmap for addressing them. The message of this paper is also to claim that if language engineering techniques to design any single (disposable) language are mature, the language engineering community needs to fundamentally change its view on software language design. We need to take the next step and adopt the perspective that a software language is, fundamentally, software too and thus the result of a composition of design decisions. These design decisions should be represented as first-class entities in the software languages workbench and it should be possible, during the language lifecycle, to add, remove and change language design decisions with limited effort to go from continuous design to continuous meta-design.}},

    abstract = {{Cloning a model is usually done by duplicating all its runtime objects into a new model. This approach leads to memory consumption problems for operations that create and manipulate large quantities of clones (e.g., design space exploration). We propose an original approach that exploits the fact that operations rarely modify a whole model. Given a set of immutable properties, our cloning approach determines the objects and fields that can be shared between the runtime representations of a model and its clones. Our generic cloning algorithm is parameterized with three strategies that establish a trade-off between memory savings and the ease of clone manipulation. We implemented the strategies within the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and evaluated memory footprints and computation overheads with 100 randomly generated metamodels and models. Results show a positive correlation between the proportion of shareable properties and memory savings, while the worst median overhead is 9,5\% when manipulating the clones.}},

   abstract = {{Recently, domain-specific language development has become again a topic of interest, as a means to help designing solutions to domain-specific problems. Componentized language frameworks, coupled with variability modeling, have the potential to bring language development to the masses, by simplifying the configuration of a new language from an existing set of reusable components. However, designing variability models for this purpose requires not only a good understanding of these frameworks and the way components interact, but also an adequate familiarity with the problem domain. In this paper we propose an approach to automatically infer a relevant variability model from a collection of already implemented language components, given a structured, but general representation of the domain. We describe techniques to assist users in achieving a better understanding of the relationships between language components, and find out which languages can be derived from them with respect to the given domain.}},

Each composition operator dedicated to a different modeling concern should be proven to be property preserving at assembly time. These proofs are usually burdensome with repetitive aspects. Our work targets the factorisation of these aspects relying on primitive generic composition operators used to express more sophisticated language specific ones. These operators are defined for languages expressed with OMG MOF metamodeling technologies. The proof are done with the Coq proof assistant relying on the Coq4MDE framework defined previously. These basic operators, Union and Substitution, are illustrated using the MOF Package Merge as composition operator and the preservation of model conformance as verified property.}},

Supporting coordinated use of DSMLs leads to what we call the globalization of modeling languages. This article presents a research initiative that broadens the DSML research focus beyond the development of independent DSMLs to one that supports globalized DSMLs, that is, DSMLs that facilitate coordination of work across different domains of expertise.}},

A major objective was to encourage collaborations and to start building a community that focused on providing solutions that support what we refer to as the globalization of domain-specific modeling languages, that is, support coordinated use of multiple languages throughout the development of complex systems.

Stakeholders are concerned by different aspects of the system, potentially supported by multiple Domain Specific Mod- eling Languages (DSMLs). The DSMLs are usually different not only in their syntax but also in their behavioral semantics. In order to pro- vide simulation and/or verification of the overall system, it is mandatory to compose the DSMLs behavioral semantics. The composition of the DSMLs behavioral semantics results in the coordination of different mod- els that conform to the DSMLs. This paper presents the coordination of the models representing a railroad crossing management system. The sys- tem is composed of two models, conforming to two different DSMLs. The paper explains the behavioral semantics of these DSMLs and presents a simple coordination of the models used in the example.}},

    abstract = {{Current metamodeling techniques can be used to specify the syntax and semantics of domain specific modeling languages (DSMLs). However, there is currently very little support for explicitly specifying concurrency semantics using metamodels. Often, such semantics are provided through implicit concurrency models embedded in the underlying execution environment supported by the language workbench used to implement the DSMLs. The lack of an explicit concurrency model has several drawbacks: it not only prevents from developing a complete understanding of the behavioral semantics, it also prevents development of effective concurrency-aware analysis techniques, and effective techniques for producing semantic variants in the cases where the semantic base has variation points. This work reifies concurrency as a metamodeling facility, leveraging formalization work from the concurrency theory and models of computation (MoC) community. The essential contribution of this paper is a proposed language workbench for binding domain-specific concepts and models of computation through an explicit event structure at the metamodel level. We illustrate these novel metamodeling facilities for designing two variants of a concurrent and timed final state machine, and provide other experiments to validate the scope of our approach.}},

    abstract = {{Model typing brings the benefit associated with well-defined type systems to model-driven development (MDD) through the assignment of specific types to models. In particular, model type systems enable reuse of model manipulation operations (e.g., model transformations), where manipulations defined for models of a supertype can be used to manipulate models of subtypes. Existing model typing approaches are limited to structural typing defined in terms of object-oriented metamodels (e.g., MOF) in which the only structural (well-formedness) constraints are those that can be expressed directly in metamodeling notations (e.g., multiplicity and element containment constraints). In this paper we describe an extension to model typing that takes into consideration structural invariants, other than those that can be expressed directly in metamodeling notation, and specifications of behaviors associated with model types. The approach supports contract-aware substitutability, where contracts are defined in terms of invariants and pre-/postconditions expressed using OCL. Support for behavioral typing paves the way for behavioral substitutability. We also describe a technique to rigorously reason about model type substitutability as supported by contracts and apply the technique in use cases from the optimizing compiler community.}},
