<h2 id="about-the-workshop">About the Workshop</h2>

<p>The increasing complexity of modern software-intensive systems demands for enhanced software engineering methods. Separation of concerns of the diverse stakeholders’ facilitates the coordinated development of system aspects implementing these concerns. These different concerns are often associated with specialized description languages and technologies, which are based on concern-specific problems and solution concepts. Hence, software developers are faced with the challenging task of integrating the different languages and associated technologies used to produce software artifacts in the different concern spaces. GEMOC 2018 will be a full-day workshop that brings together researchers and practitioners in the modeling languages community to discuss the challenges associated with integrating multiple, heterogeneous modeling languages. The languages of interest range from requirements, to design and runtime languages, and include both general-purpose and domain-specific languages. Challenges related to engineering composable languages, well-formed semantic composition of languages and reasoning about systems described using heterogeneous languages are of particular interest. Following the previous editions, a major objective is to continue collaborations and to expand a community that is focused on solving the problems arising from the <em>globalization of modeling languages</em>; i.e., the use of multiple DSLs to support coordinated development of diverse aspects of a system.</p>

<p>GEMOC 2018 will provide an open forum for sharing experiences, problems and solutions on the conjoint use of multiple modeling languages. This workshop will be the place where concrete artifacts, ideas and opinions are exchanged in order to reap constructive feedback. Following the previous editions, a major objective is to continue collaborations and to expand a community that is focused on solving the problems arising from <em>the globalization of modeling languages</em>; i.e., the use of multiple DSLs to support coordinated development of diverse aspects of a system.</p>

<p> Software is everywhere we go. Among others, it powers the devices
 we use in our daily life, it channels our social interactions via social
 media, it enables our medical care. With the increasing number of
 applications, the amount of software is exponentially increasing,
 which challenges the way we develop and maintain our software
 efficiently and effectively.</p>

<p>  The software engineering (research) community is fully aware
 of these challenges and attempts to tackle these by introducing
 new development techniques, such as Agile software development,
 test-driven software development and model driven software technology. The latter advocates the use of models and domain specific
 languages (DSLs) to speed up the development of software, to increase understandability and quality of the resulting software.</p>

 <p> Modeling and modeling languages are common practice in other
 engineering domains, such as mechanical engineering. Modeling in
 software development has accelerated with the launch of Unified
 Modeling Language (UML). The use of multiple modeling languages
 in UML has led to the development of Meta Object Facility (MOF)
 and its derivative Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF). Model driven
 software engineering advocates the use of small languages that are
 domain specific, provide a higher level of abstraction and facilitate
 code generation. UML already offered the possibility to create domain specific extensions via profiles. MOF and specifically EMF
 have given rise to the creation of small languages using the Eclipse
 environment. EMF and the tooling using EMF, such as Xtext, ATL,
 QVTo, ETL, etc., has led to an acceleration of the development of
 domain specific languages.</p>

<p>  The following challenges can be observed with respect to this
 development.
<ul>
 <li>The tooling used to create and use DSLs is far from mature,
 is unstable, and gets rapidly deprecated. There is still a lot
 of effort needed to improve the existing tooling.</li>

 <li> The creation of a DSL involves understanding of the domain
 for which the languages is created and having the capability
 of translating this knowledge to concepts at the right level
 of abstraction.</li>
 <li> The increased level of abstraction and introduction of domain concepts makes the models harder to understand and
 maintain. The use of DSLs involves also a risk, if the developer(s) of a DSL leaves the company then the maintenance of
 the DSL may be jeopardized. The number of developers that
 are able to understand and maintain DSLs is low; the number
 of developers understanding general purpose languages, e.g.
 C, will always be higher.</li>
 <li> The interactions between software models and models from
 other (system) engineering domains, e.g. describing physical
 behavior, are becoming more and more important.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>  The (high-tech) industry has adopted model driven software
 engineering and started introducing DSLs. These DSLs are prototypical, because capturing and defining domain concepts as well
 as language development is new for them. Before the DSLs stabilizes, tens and sometimes even hundreds of models may already be
 created. These models have to be migrated and can not be thrown
 away, if the DSLs are adapted. These languages and corresponding
 models will become legacy if we do not act by means of developing
 proper development methodologies and tooling to support analysis of languages and models and the evolution of both languages
 and models. So, both language and domain are in state of flux and
 have to co-evolve, both on the syntactic but definitively also on the
 semantic level, but this is hard and difficult work. We do not have
 the tools for this and if we do not act now, we will have the same
 legacy as we have software from a code perspective</p>

<p>  One can wonder whether model driven software engineering is
 indeed the next silver bullet to transform software development
 or rather a silver-painted egg that when being fired creates a big
 mess. Research on model driven techniques should move away
 from just focusing on tooling, although that still work has to be
 done to make the tools more robust and usable, but start focusing
 on proper methodologies to extract domain concepts in order to
 create usable DSLs. It should deal with evolutionary aspects of DSLs
 and created models and work on stabilizing the tooling needed to
 create languages and corresponding models, ensuring consistency
 between languages and between models, and between languages
 and models. These are just a few of the challenges that we are
 facing. If we are able to make this happen then we might have
 a silver bullet after all and the promised increase in quality and
 productivity can be realized.</p>

<h3 id="context-and-motivation">Context and Motivation</h3>

<p>Software intensive systems are becoming more complex, driven by the need to integrate across multiple concerns. Consequently, the development of such systems requires the integration of different concerns and skills. These concerns are usually covered by different languages, with specific concepts, technologies and abstraction levels. This multiplication of languages eases the development related to one specific concern but raises language and technology integration problems at the different stages of the software life cycle. In order to reason about the global system, it becomes necessary to explicitly describe the different kinds of relationships that exist between the different languages used in the development of a complex system. To support effective language integration, there is a pressing need to reify and classify these relationships, as well as the language interactions that the relationships enable.</p>

<p>The 2018 edition of the GEMOC workshop will follow the successful previous five editions: <a href="/events/gemoc2013.html">GEMOC at MODELS 2013</a> in Miami, USA, <a href="/events/gemoc2014.html">GEMOC at MODELS 2014</a> in Valencia, Spain, <a href="/events/gemoc2015.html">GEMOC at MODELS 2015</a> in Ottawa, Canada, <a href="/events/gemoc2016.html">GEMOC at MODELS 2016</a> in Saint-Malo, France, and <a href="/events/gemoc2017.html">GEMOC at MODELS 2017</a> in Austin, TX, USA.
This edition will complete the state-of-the-art and practice initiated during the last years.
<!--
This edition will also continue to investigate the language interfaces required in the context of the globalization of modeling languages. Additionally, it will study the possible relationships with the viewpoint engineering and the notion of multi-paradigm modeling.
-->
It will also strengthen the community that broadens the current DSML research focus beyond the development of independent DSMLs to a research focus that provides support for globalized DSMLs.</p>

<p>GEMOC 2018 is supported by <a href="/">the GEMOC initiative</a> and its associated Eclipse Research consortium, which promotes research seeking to develop the necessary breakthroughs in software languages to support global software engineering, i.e., breakthroughs that lead to effective technologies supporting different forms of language integration, including language collaboration, interoperability and composability.</p>

<h3 id="workshop-format">Workshop Format</h3>

<p>The format of the workshop reflects the goals of the workshop: constructive feedback on submitted papers and other artifacts on the conjoint use of different modeling languages, collaborations, and community building. The format of the workshop is that of a working meeting. Hence, there is less focus on presentations and more focus on producing and documenting a research content that identifies challenges, different forms of language integration, and relates existing solutions.</p>

<p>The workshop consists of a morning session in which a keynote and short presentations of the accepted papers will be given. A significant amount of time will be reserved for discussing each paper and their relations to each other. The afternoon session is devoted to a working session dedicated to open discussions of the presented contributions and other topics suggested by the participants. The closing session is dedicated to develop a plan to publish the results of the discussion in a final workshop report.</p>

<h3 id="topics">Topics</h3>

<p>The topics of interest for GEMOC 2018 include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tools and methods for engineering modeling languages</li>
  <li>Composability and interoperability of heterogeneous modeling languages</li>
  <li>Language integration challenges, from requirement to design, for analysis and simulation, during runtime, etc.</li>
  <li>Model and metamodel composition</li>
