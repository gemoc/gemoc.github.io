<h2 id="about-the-workshop">About the Workshop</h2>

<p>To cope with complexity, modern software-intensive systems are often split in different concerns, which serve diverse stakeholders and must address a variety of concerns. These different concerns are often associated with specialized description languages and technologies, which are based on concern-specific problems and solution concepts. Software developers are thus faced with the challenging task of integrating the different languages and associated technologies used to produce software artifacts in the different concern spaces.</p>

<p>Part of an ongoing series, the proposed GEMOC 2015 will be a full-day workshop that brings together researchers and practitioners in the modeling languages community to discuss the challenges associated with integrating multiple, heterogeneous modeling languages. The languages of interest range from requirements, to design and runtime languages, and include both general-purpose and domain-specific languages. Challenges related to engineering composable languages, well-formed semantic composition of languages and reasoning about systems described using heterogeneous languages are of particular interest.</p>

<p>GEMOC 2015 will provide an open forum for sharing experiences, problems and solutions on the conjoint use of multiple modeling languages. This workshop will be the place where concrete artifacts, ideas and opinions are exchanged in order to reap constructive feedback. Following the two first editions, a major objective is to continue collaborations and to expand a community that is focused on solving the problems arising from <em>the globalization of modeling languages</em>; i.e., the use of multiple DSLs to support coordinated development of diverse aspects of a system.</p>

  <p><em>This is not a talk about dating or web sites for the lovelorn. Instead, we consider the somewhat neglected concept of relationship as encountered in computer science and software engineering. In these domains, relationships are encountered in many different forms: as associations and dependencies in modeling languages, as relationships in ER models,</em></p>

  <p>In their reputation for science it is usually asserted the best breakthroughs originated from analysts who wanted to know their own self the most appropriate questions. In my opinion, not only because of this, many of these individuals were fortunate and were in the right time and place thanks to their perseverance <a href="http://writer4sale.com/">write my essay</a> This series will be the most crucial element of coming up with a learning. The time spent, time, strategy or even the affect associated with the report while in the controlled area be determined by this period really being administered in the right manner. On the flip side, also, it is most likely the most tedious stage to organize. There are thousands of factors that vary depending wholly on you and your rapport with the elected subject.</p>

  <p><em>as pointers and references in programming languages, and so on. In most of these cases, the concept of a relationship is defined primarily in syntactic terms, devoid of meaningful contextual information such as the specific semantics of the entities that are being related or the significance and exact nature of the connection between them. Even the so-called “semantic Web”, which is purported to focus semantics, reduces relationships to generic syntactic categories (e.g., subject-predicate-object). This seems like a wasted opportunity, since available meaningful information about the nature of a relationship is being discarded. As a result, responsibility for supporting the semantics of relationships is shifted to custom program code. The consequence of this is that we have to write new code for each specific type of relationship, leading to a needless profusion of complex and problematic software.In this talk, we pose a challenge to the modeling community: how can we enrich the concept of relationships with useful context-specific (i.e., semantic) information. One of the most obvious potential benefits of this wold be simpler and more generic software. In a way, this appears to be merely an evolution of the key idea behind the object paradigm, where the semantics of an object are the responsibility of the object itself.</em></p>

<p><strong>01:30-05:00:</strong> Session 2: <em>Looking at the past and the future of the globalization of modeling languages</em></p>

<p>This session is an open forum for the workshop participants to discuss their past contributions and future research focus. The goal is to cross-fertilize ideas and to act as an incubator for short and long term collaborations. The afternoon session is split into discussion periods that each look at the past and future concerns of the globalization of modeling languages.</p>

<p><strong>Looking at the Past</strong>: This is a flexible session that aims to provide a big picture of the activities realized, by the community, during the previous year through short, informal and interruptible presentations (whiteboard, few slides, pictures, poster, demo, or whatever can help). The presentations last from 1 to 20 minutes, including a substantial discussion portion. The program of this session will include, but not restricted to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>BCOOL: A Behavioral Coordination Operator Language</li>
  <li>MoccML: A Meta-Language for the Concurrency Concern in DSLs</li>
  <li>Melange: Modular and Reusable DSL Design and Implementation</li>
  <li>Omniscient Debugging within the GEMOC Studio</li>
  <li>On the usefulness of Model Tying for Enterprise Architecture</li>
  <li>Traceability Between Requirements, Design, and Implementation</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Looking toward the Future</strong>: This second session offers additional flexibility with a focus on new and emerging ideas that the community is working on. Participants will be encouraged to think about the globalization of modeling languages from “outside of the box.”  The goal is to help define the future challenge problems and research focus of the  community (e.g., definition and prioritization of new threads of work, new collaborations or even new themes). Presentations related to the globalization of modeling languages are open to everyone and will be informal/interactive. The maximum presentation time is 20 minutes including a substantial portion of discussions.The program of this session will include, but not restricted to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>FMI for the GEMOC Studio</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<p>The format of the workshop reflects the goals of the workshop: constructive feedback on submitted papers and models on the conjoint use of different modeling languages, collaboration, and community building. The format of the workshop is that of a working meeting. Hence, there is less of a focus on presentations and more focus on producing and documenting a research roadmap that identifies challenges, different forms of language integration, and relates existing solutions.</p>

<p>The workshop will consist of a morning session in which a keynote and short presentations of the accepted papers will be given. A significant amount of time will be reserved for discussion of each paper and their relations to each other. The afternoon will be devoted to a working session dedicated to open discussions of the presented contributions and other topics suggested by the participants. We will lead the discussion towards a classification of existing and proposed forms of language integration, as well as a description of the language interfaces required in the context of the globalization of modeling languages. We will close with a working session to develop a plan to publish the results of the discussion in a final workshop report.</p>

<h2 id="call-for-papers--models">Call for Papers / Models</h2>

<h3 id="context-and-motivation">Context and Motivation</h3>

<p>This proposed 2015 edition of the GEMOC workshop will follow the successful previous two editions: <a href="/events/gemoc2013.html">GEMOC at MODELS 2013</a> in Miami, FL, USA, and <a href="/events/gemoc2014.html">GEMOC at MODELS 2014</a> in Valencia, Spain. This new edition will complete the state of the art and practice initiated last year. This edition will also investigate the language interfaces required in the context of the globalization of modeling languages, and the possible relationships with the viewpoint engineering. It will also strengthen the community that broadens the current DSML research focus beyond the development of independent DSMLs to a research focus that provides support for globalized DSMLs.</p>

<p>GEMOC 2015 is supported by <a href="/">the GEMOC initiative</a>, which promotes research seeking to develop the necessary breakthroughs in software languages to support global software engineering, i.e., breakthroughs that lead to effective technologies supporting different forms of language integration, including language collaboration, interoperability and composability.</p>

<h3 id="topics">Topics</h3>

<p>The topics of interest for GEMOC 2015 include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Composability and interoperability of heterogeneous modeling languages</li>
  <li>Language integration challenges, from requirement to design, for analysis and simulation, during runtime, etc.</li>
  <li>Model and metamodel composition</li>
  <li>Language interface, viewpoint</li>
  <li>Heterogeneous modeling and simulation</li>
  <li>Language-based socio-technical coordination</li>
</ul>

<p>Submissions describing practical and industrial experience related to the use of heterogeneous modeling languages are also encouraged, particularly in the following application domains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cyber-Physical Systems, System of Systems</li>
  <li>Internet of Services, Internet of Things</li>
  <li>Complex Adaptive Systems</li>
  <li>Smart City, Smart Building, Home automation</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="types-of-contributions">Types of Contributions</h3>

<p>As contributions, we expect descriptions of case studies on the coordinated use of multiple modeling languages, and/or descriptions of practical experience, opinions and related approaches. Authors will be invited to submit short papers describing (i) their language integration experience, or (ii) novel approaches for integrating modeling languages. Authors will also be invited to provide archived full versions of models used to illustrate their novel approach or experience on <a href="http://www.cs.colostate.edu/remodd/v1/">the Repository for Model-Driven Development</a> (ReMoDD). This will allow participants to share their models with each other and the wider modeling community before and after the workshop.</p>

<p>Each contribution must be described in a short paper not exceeding 6 pages in the LNCS format (to be confirmed according to the requirements from the main conference). Each paper should describe problems, case studies, or solutions related to the topics of interest. Each paper is expected to highlight the relationships between modeling languages, as well as their management.</p>

<p>Papers that describe use cases, or novel integration approaches can be accompanied by concrete artifacts, such as models (requirements, design, analysis, transformation, composition, etc.), stored in ReMoDD. Artifacts should illustrate any experience on the conjoint use of different modeling languages.</p>
