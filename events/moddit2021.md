TBA. 


### Workshop Format

TBA. 

### Workshop Outcomes

TBA. (discussions, proceedings, manifesto, community)

### Submission

The following types of submissions are solicited:

- Research papers (up to 8 pages)
- Short papers (up to 4 pages)
- TBA.

As contributions, we expect early research results about the aforementioned topics, descriptions of problems, case studies, experience reports or solutions related to the topics of interest. We also strongly encourage the submission of comparative studies and benchmarks of existing approaches in one of the topics. Short papers can also describe tool demonstrations or position papers. 

Papers that describe use cases or novel approaches can be accompanied by concrete artifacts, such as models (requirements, design, analysis, transformation, composition, etc.), stored in a public repository. Artifacts should illustrate any experience on digital twins.


All submissions have to follow the [the IEEE format](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html) and must be [submitted electronically in PDF format via Easychair](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=moddit2021). 

All submissions will be evaluated by at least three members of the program committee. Research papers, experience reports, and tool demonstration papers will be evaluated concerning novelty, correctness, significance, readability, and alignment with the workshop call. Short (position) papers will be evaluated primarily concerning the validity and the ability to generate discussion (even controversy), as well as alignment with the workshop call. Furthermore, all submissions must be original work and must not have been previously published or being under review elsewhere.

The accepted papers will be published as IEEE online proceedings and indexed in DBLP and Scopus.
