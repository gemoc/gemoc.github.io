## About the Workshop

Digital twins promise tremendous potential to better understand and make use of cyber-physical systems in automotive, avionics, manufacturing, medicine, and many more domains. Despite many of the twinned systems being developed using models, engineering digital twins currently is ad-hoc and demands integrating different piecemeal technologies, which effectively hinders the application of digital twins. The focus of many digital twins and frameworks to create digital twins is on data acquisition and visualization via dashboards. Current research on digital twins focuses on specific implementations (bottom-up) or abstract models on how digital twins could be conceived (top down). Yet, there is a huge gap between both views that only research on model-driven engineering (MDE) can reduce. Hence, MDE is crucial to fully and systematically leverage the potential of digital twins. Currently, a venue bringing together experts from the modelling community on this topic is missing: ModDIT’21 brings together researchers on and developers of digital twins come together to shape the future of systematically designing, engineering, evolving, maintaining, and evaluating digital twins.

## Call for Papers

### Topics

Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to:

-	Modelling concepts and languages, methods, and tools for developing digital twins
-	Digital twins for DevOps
-	Quality assurance for and evaluation of digital twins
-	Deployment and operation of digital twins
-	Model consistency, management, and evolution of engineering models
-	Architectural patterns for digital twins
-	Digital twins for continual learning and continuous improvement
-	Combining models and data in digital twins
-	Digital twins for dynamic (re)configuration and optimization
-	Case studies, experience reports, comparisons

### Submission

The following types of submissions are solicited:

-	Regular papers (max 8 pages): These are “traditional” papers detailing research contributions to model-driven development of digital twins.
-	Short papers (max 4 pages): These are forward-looking papers about ideas that will interest the workshop attendees but which are not currently at an advanced level of research. These might be about new research avenues, research statements or positions, or about integrating existing research ideas, or technologies.
-	Tool demonstration papers (max 4 pages): These are papers which focus on the tooling aspects. A good tool paper focuses on practical insights that are likely to be useful to other implementers or users of digital twins in the future. Any of the aforementioned topics of interest are appropriate areas for tool demonstrations. Submissions must not exceed 4 pages. They may optionally come with an appendix with a demo outline / screenshots and/or a short video/screencast illustrating the tool.
-	Exemplar papers (max 4 pages): These are implementations or detailed specifications of digital twins that pose and highlight fundamental or characteristic challenges for the modelling community. Submissions must not exceed 4 pages. They may optionally come with an appendix with further materials, or a short video/screencast illustrating the exemplar.

Submissions must adhere to the IEEE formatting instructions, which can be found at: [IEEE - Manuscript Templates for Conference Proceedings](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html), and must be submitted via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=moddit2021).

Submissions that do not adhere to these limits or that violate the formatting guidelines will be desk-rejected without review. Accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings published of MODELS. Selected papers from the workshop will be invited to revise and submit extended versions of the papers for publication in a well-known journal.

## Important Dates

- Abstract submission deadline: **July 20, 2021** (extended)
- Paper submission deadline: **July 27, 2021** (extended)
- Notification of acceptance: **August 25, 2021** (extended)
- Camera ready submission deadline: **September 3, 2021** (extended)
- Workshop: TBA.

## Keynote

We are pleased to annouce that [Prof. Bernhard Rumpe](https://www.se-rwth.de/staff/rumpe/) will give a keynote entitled "Modelling for and of Digital Twins". 

  > Abstract: A digital twin shares a lot of characteristics with a model. However, there are also a lot of differences. A digital twin is like a real twin: it is an active instance that interacts with the real system. We discuss definitions and variants of digital twins and we closely examine possibilities to systematically derive digital twins from development models and thus deepen the shared characteristics of models and digital twins.

  > [Prof. Bernhard Rumpe](https://www.se-rwth.de/staff/rumpe/) is heading the Software Engineering department at the RWTH Aachen University, Germany. The RWTH Aachen is one of the Excellence Universities in Germany with a strong focus on engineering and its scientific foundations. His main interests are rigorous and practical software and system development methods based on adequate modeling techniques. This includes agile development methods like XP and SCRUM as well as model-engineering based on UML-like notations and domain specific languages. The working groups have contributed to many modeling techniques, including the UML standardization. The group is well integrated in strategic efforts, such as the Internet-Of-Production Excellence cluster (IoP) and the Aachen Center for Systems Engineering (CSE), where digital twins are in deep focus. His newest book on the MontiCore Language workbench has been released earlier this year.
