## About the Workshop

Digital twins promise tremendous potential to better understand and make use of cyber-physical systems in automotive, avionics, manufacturing, medicine, and many more domains. Despite many of the twinned systems being developed using models, engineering digital twins currently is ad-hoc and demands integrating different piecemeal technologies, which effectively hinders the application of digital twins. The focus of many digital twins and frameworks to create digital twins is on data acquisition and visualization via dashboards. Current research on digital twins focuses on specific implementations (bottom-up) or abstract models on how digital twins could be conceived (top down). Yet, there is a huge gap between both views that only research on model-driven engineering (MDE) can reduce. Hence, MDE is crucial to fully and systematically leverage the potential of digital twins. Currently, a venue bringing together experts from the modelling community on this topic is missing: ModDIT’21 brings together researchers on and developers of digital twins come together to shape the future of systematically designing, engineering, evolving, maintaining, and evaluating digital twins.

## Call for Papers

### Topics

Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to:

-	Modelling concepts and languages, methods, and tools for developing digital twins
-	Digital twins for DevOps
-	Quality assurance for and evaluation of digital twins
-	Deployment and operation of digital twins
-	Model consistency, management, and evolution of engineering models
-	Architectural patterns for digital twins
-	Digital twins for continual learning and continuous improvement
-	Combining models and data in digital twins
-	Digital twins for dynamic (re)configuration and optimization
-	Case studies, experience reports, comparisons

### Submission

The following types of submissions are solicited:

-	Regular papers (max 8 pages): These are “traditional” papers detailing research contributions to model-driven development of digital twins.
-	Short papers (max 5 pages): These are forward-looking papers about ideas that will interest the workshop attendees but which are not currently at an advanced level of research. These might be about new research avenues, research statements or positions, or about integrating existing research ideas, or technologies.
-	Tool demonstration papers (max 5 pages): These are papers which focus on the tooling aspects. A good tool paper focuses on practical insights that are likely to be useful to other implementers or users of digital twins in the future. Any of the aforementioned topics of interest are appropriate areas for tool demonstrations. Submissions must not exceed 5 pages. They may optionally come with an appendix with a demo outline / screenshots and/or a short video/screencast illustrating the tool.
-	Exemplar papers (max 5 pages): These are implementations or detailed specifications of digital twins that pose and highlight fundamental or characteristic challenges for the modelling community. Submissions must not exceed 5 pages. They may optionally come with an appendix with further materials, or a short video/screencast illustrating the exemplar.

Submissions must adhere to the ACM formatting instructions, which can be found at https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template for both LaTeX and Word users. LaTeX users must use the provided acmart.cls and ACM-Reference-Format.bst without modification, enable the conference format in the preamble of the document (i.e., \documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart}), and use the ACM reference format for the bibliography (i.e., \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}). The review option adds line numbers, thereby allowing referees to refer to specific lines in their comments.

Submissions must be made via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=moddit22).
Submissions that do not adhere to these limits or that violate the formatting guidelines will be desk-rejected without review. Accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings published of MODELS. Selected papers from the workshop will be invited to revise and submit extended versions of the papers for publication in a well-known journal.

## Important Dates

- Abstract submission deadline: **July 13, 2022**
- Paper submission deadline: **July 20, 2022**
- Notification of acceptance: **August 19, 2022**
- Camera ready submission deadline: **August 26, 2022**
- Workshop: **tbc in range October 23-25**

## Keynotes

We are pleased to annouce that the workshop will have two keynotes.

Dr. Marie-José Montpetit will give a keynote entitled "Digital twinning in distributed systems: bringing data and models together".

  > Abstract: The trend towards system softwarization is accelerating, driven by powerful computing power at the edge and in the  cloud, broadband everywhere and the increasing use of machine learning and artificial intelligence in decision making. Novel application range from networking, medicine, advanced manufacturing and precision agriculture amongst other.  In that context, digital twins based on powerful cyber-physical modeling, are now used in performance evaluation, hypothesis testing and decision support systems everywhere. They reach beyond traditional simulators that relied on hardware components,  and include goal-driven analysis and re-enforcement learning. At the same time, sensors are now gathering large amounts of data that contain a system's response to specific stimuli. Statistical modelling allows to indentify key system variables and infer both long term and short term behaviour and deep learning identifies the best condition for operating the systems.  The data validate the twins and in return the twins enable more data to be generated. The presentation will focus on a specific use case of modeling and data analysis in the context of a distributed machine learning system in controlled environment agriculture.


  > [Dr. Marie-José Montpetit](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mjmontpetit/) is a well known researcher in Internet of Things, distributed networking and computing in the network. Her current interests englobe how artificial intelligence is impacting these fields and how in particular to apply AI to industrial and networking systems. She is an affiliate professor at Concordia University in Montreal and at Telecom-Paris Sud and a consultant to Iowa State university. She is also a lead designer at Ferme d’Hiver a Montreal region startup in controlled environment agriculture.

Prof. Érik Poirier and Prof. Ali Motamedi will give a keynote entitled "Digital twins for the built environement: challenges, opportunities and the way forward". (Abstract and short biographies will be added later.)
