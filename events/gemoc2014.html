<h2 id="about-the-workshop">About the Workshop</h2>

<p>To cope with complexity, modern software-intensive systems are often split in different concerns, which serve diverse stakeholder groups and thus must address a variety of stakeholder concerns. These different concerns are often associated with specialized description languages and technologies, which are based on concern-specific problems and solution concepts. Software developers are thus faced with the challenging task of integrating the different languages and associated technologies used to produce software artifacts in the different concern spaces.</p>

<p>Part of the series, GEMOC 2014 is a full-day workshop that will bring together researchers and practitioners in the modeling languages community to discuss the challenges associated with integrating multiple, heterogeneous modeling languages. The languages of interest range from requirements to runtime languages, and include both general-purpose and domain-specific languages. Challenges related to engineering composable languages, well-formed semantic composition of languages and to reasoning about systems described using heterogeneous languages are of particular interest.</p>

<p>GEMOC 2014 will provide an open forum for sharing experiences, problems and solutions on the conjoint use of multiple modeling languages. This workshop will be the place where concrete artifacts, ideas and opinions are exchanged in order to reap constructive feedback. Following the first edition last year, a major objective of this 2014 edition is to continue collaborations and to expand a community that is focused on solving the problems arising from the globalization of modeling languages.</p>

  <p><em>Model-driven software development and systems engineering rely on modeling languages that provide efficient, domain-specific abstractions for design, analysis, and implementation. Models are essential for communicating ideas across the engineering team, but also key to the analysis of the system. No single model or modeling language can cover all aspects of a system, and even for particular aspects multiple modeling languages are used in the same system. Thus engineers face the dilemma of either defining a unifying semantics for all models, or finding a solution to the model integration problem. The talk will elaborate these problems, and show two, potential solutions: one using a model integration language (for the engineering design domain) and another one using explicit and executable semantics (for the domain of distributed reactive controllers).</em></p>

<p><strong>04:00-05:30:</strong> Discussions on language globalization, survey on current practices.</p>

<p>The format of the workshop reflects the goals of the workshop: constructive feedback on submitted papers and models on the conjoint use of different modeling languages, collaboration, and community building. The format of the workshop is that of a working meeting. Hence, there is less of a focus on presentations and more focus on producing and documenting a research roadmap that identifies challenges, different forms of language integration, and relates existing solutions.</p>

<p>The workshop will consist of a morning session in which a keynote and short presentations of the accepted papers will be given. A significant amount of time will be reserved for discussion of paper and their relations to each others. The afternoon will be devoted to a working session dedicated to open discussions of the presented contributions. We will lead the discussion towards a classification of existing and proposed forms of language integration. We will close with a working session to develop a work plan to publish the results of the discussion in a final workshop report.</p>

<h3 id="context-and-motivation">Context and Motivation</h3>

<p>Software intensive systems are becoming more and more complex and communicative. Consequently, the development of such systems requires the integration of many different concerns and skills. These concerns are usually covered by different languages, with specific concepts, technologies and abstraction levels. This multiplication of languages eases the development related to one specific concern but raises language and technology integration problems at the different stages of the software life cycle. In order to reason about the global system, it becomes necessary to explicitly describe the different kinds of relationships that exist between the different languages used in the development of a complex system. To support effective language</p>

<p>To the reputation for scientific disciplines it is often declared that the nice discoveries derive from investigators who expected themselves a good basic questions. In my opinion, not only because of this, many of these individuals were fortunate and were in the right place and time thanks to their perseverance <a href="http://essayargumentative.com/">cheap essay writing service</a> This series is a most prominent an element of having a scientific study. The time devoted, time, methodology and sometimes even the effects connected with an report throughout the technological regional community count on this part actually being undertaken carefully. Alternatively, it can also be the more stressful state to plan. There are a number variables that rely wholly on both you and your relationship having the decided upon style.</p>

<p>integration, there is a pressing need to reify and classify these relationships, as well as the language interactions that the relationships enable. In this context, the workshop GEMOC 2014 aims to attract submissions that outline language integration approaches, case studies, or that identify and discuss well defined problems about the management of relationships between heterogeneous modeling languages. The goal is to facilitate good discussions among the participants that lead to an initial classification of the kinds of language relationships and their management.</p>

<p>This edition 2014 of the GEMOC workshop will follow <a href="/events/gemoc2013.html">the successful first edition at MODELS 2013 in Miami, FL, USA</a>. This new edition will complete the state of the art and practice started last year. It will also strengthen the community that broadens the current DSML research focus beyond the development of independent DSMLs to one that provides support for globalized DSMLs.</p>

<p>GEMOC 2014 is supported by <a href="/">the GEMOC initiative</a> that promotes research seeking to develop the necessary breakthroughs in software languages to support global software engineering, i.e., breakthroughs that lead to effective technologies supporting different forms of language integration, including language collaboration, interoperability and composability.</p>

<h3 id="topics">Topics</h3>

<p>The topics of interest for GEMOC 2014 include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Composability and interoperability of heterogeneous modeling languages</li>
  <li>Language integration challenges, from requirement to design, for analysis and simulation, during runtime, etc.</li>
  <li>Model and metamodel composition</li>
  <li>Heterogeneous modeling and simulation</li>
</ul>

<p>Submissions describing practical and industrial experience related to the use of heterogeneous modeling languages are also encouraged, particularly in the following application domains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cyber-Physical Systems, System of Systems</li>
  <li>Smart City, Smart Building, Home automation</li>
  <li>Complex Adaptive Systems</li>
  <li>Internet of Services, Internet of Things</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="types-of-contributions">Types of Contributions</h3>

<p>We expect as contributions, descriptions of case studies on coordinated use of multiple modeling languages, and/or descriptions of practical experience, opinions and related approaches. Authors will be invited to submit short papers describing (i) their language integration experience, or (ii) novel approaches for integrating modeling languages. Authors will also be invited to store full versions of models used to illustrate their novel approach or experience on <a href="http://www.cs.colostate.edu/remodd/v1/">the Repository for Model Driven Development (ReMoDD)</a>. This allows us to share the models with participants and the wider modeling community before and after the workshop.</p>

<p>Each contribution must be described in short paper (6 pages) or long paper (10 pages) in the LNCS format. Each paper should describe problems, case studies, and solutions related to the topics of interest. Each paper is expected to highlight the relationships between modeling languages as well as their management.</p>

<p>Papers that describe novel or existing integration approaches should be accompanied by concrete artifacts, such as models (requirement, design, analysis, transformation, composition, etc.), stored in ReMoDD. Artifacts should illustrate any experience on the conjoint use of different modeling languages.</p>

<p>Submitted articles must not have been previously published or currently be submitted for publication elsewhere. The program chairs will apply the principles of the ACM Plagiarism Policy throughout the submission and review process. All contributions will be reviewed and selected by the program committee members.</p>

<h3 id="submission">Submission</h3>

<p>Each contribution must not exceed 6 pages (short paper) or 10 pages (long papers) in the LNCS format and <a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=gemoc2014">must be submitted electronically in pdf format via Easychair</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, the concrete models referenced in a contribution should be submitted to <a href="http://www.cs.colostate.edu/remodd/v1/content/gemocmodels2014">ReMoDD</a>. To do so, authors will have to do the following:
Create a ReMoDD account if they do not have one and and join the GEMOC@MODELS2014 group.
Create a Group Post (see right side of ReMoDD website) for the GEMOC@MODELS2014 group, provide a title, and attach your concrete artefacts file to this post.</p>

<h3 id="publication">Publication</h3>

<p>The accepted papers will be published by CEUR in the workshop proceedings, which is indexed by DBLP. Moreover, the models will be published on ReMoDD. Also, participants will be strongly encouraged to participate in preparing the workshop report. This report will provide a classification of the possible relationships between modeling languages and a survey of integration approaches.</p>
