## About the Workshop

(to be updated)

Digital twins promise tremendous potential to better understand and make use of cyber-physical systems in automotive, avionics, manufacturing, medicine, and many more domains. Despite many of the twinned systems being developed using models, engineering digital twins currently is ad-hoc and demands integrating different piecemeal technologies, which effectively hinders the application of digital twins. The focus of many digital twins and frameworks to create digital twins is on data acquisition and visualization via dashboards. Current research on digital twins focuses on specific implementations (bottom-up) or abstract models on how digital twins could be conceived (top down). Yet, there is a huge gap between both views that only research on model-driven engineering (MDE) can reduce. Hence, MDE is crucial to fully and systematically leverage the potential of digital twins. Currently, a venue bringing together experts from the modelling community on this topic is missing: ModDIT’21 brings together researchers on and developers of digital twins come together to shape the future of systematically designing, engineering, evolving, maintaining, and evaluating digital twins.

## Call for Papers

(to be updated)

### Topics

Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to:

-	Modelling concepts and languages, methods, and tools for developing digital twins
-	Digital twins for DevOps
-	Quality assurance for and evaluation of digital twins
-	Deployment and operation of digital twins
-	Model consistency, management, and evolution of engineering models
-	Architectural patterns for digital twins
-	Digital twins for continual learning and continuous improvement
-	Combining models and data in digital twins
-	Digital twins for dynamic (re)configuration and optimization
-	Case studies, experience reports, comparisons

### Submission

The following types of submissions are solicited:

-	Regular papers (max 8 pages): These are “traditional” papers detailing research contributions to model-driven development of digital twins.
-	Short papers (max 5 pages): These are forward-looking papers about ideas that will interest the workshop attendees but which are not currently at an advanced level of research. These might be about new research avenues, research statements or positions, or about integrating existing research ideas, or technologies.
-	Tool demonstration papers (max 5 pages): These are papers which focus on the tooling aspects. A good tool paper focuses on practical insights that are likely to be useful to other implementers or users of digital twins in the future. Any of the aforementioned topics of interest are appropriate areas for tool demonstrations. Submissions must not exceed 5 pages. They may optionally come with an appendix with a demo outline / screenshots and/or a short video/screencast illustrating the tool.
-	Exemplar papers (max 5 pages): These are implementations or detailed specifications of digital twins that pose and highlight fundamental or characteristic challenges for the modelling community. Submissions must not exceed 5 pages. They may optionally come with an appendix with further materials, or a short video/screencast illustrating the exemplar.

Submissions must adhere to the ACM formatting instructions, which can be found at https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template for both LaTeX and Word users. LaTeX users must use the provided acmart.cls and ACM-Reference-Format.bst without modification, enable the conference format in the preamble of the document (i.e., \documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart}), and use the ACM reference format for the bibliography (i.e., \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}). The review option adds line numbers, thereby allowing referees to refer to specific lines in their comments.

Submissions must be made via EasyChair (link to instance to be added).
Submissions that do not adhere to these limits or that violate the formatting guidelines will be desk-rejected without review. Note that for each accepted paper, at least one author has to register and attend in person to present their paper. Accepted papers will then be published in the workshop proceedings published of MODELS. Selected papers from the workshop will be invited to revise and submit extended versions of the papers for publication in a well-known journal.

## Important Dates

- Abstract submission deadline: Monday July 10th, 2023
- Paper submission deadline: Monday July 17h, 2023
- Notification of acceptance: Tuesday August 15th, 2023
- Camera ready submission deadline: Tuesday August 22nd, 2023
- Workshop: to be decided, between Sunday October 1st and Tuesday October 3rd, 2023
