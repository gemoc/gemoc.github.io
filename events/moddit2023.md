## About the Workshop

Digital twin (DT) is a concept that is gaining growing attention in many disciplines to support engineering, monitoring, controlling, and optimizing cyber-
physical systems (CPSs) and beyond. It refers to the ability to clone an actual system into a virtual counterpart, that reflects all the important properties and characteristics of the original system within a specific application context. While the benefits of DT have been demonstrated in many contexts, their development, maintenance, and evolution, yield major challenges. Part of these needs to be addressed from a Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) perspective. MoDDiT’23 aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners on DTs to shape the future of systematically designing, engineering, evolving, maintaining, and evaluating DTs across different disciplines.

## Call for Papers

### Topics

Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to:

-	Modelling concepts and languages, methods, and tools for developing digital twins
-	Digital twins for DevOps
-	Quality assurance for and evaluation of digital twins
-	Deployment and operation of digital twins
-	Model consistency, management, and evolution of engineering models
-	Architectural patterns for digital twins
-	Digital twins for continual learning and continuous improvement
-	Combining models and data in digital twins
-	Digital twins for dynamic (re)configuration and optimization
-	Case studies, experience reports, comparisons

### Submission

The following types of submissions are solicited:

-	Regular papers (5–10 pages): These are “traditional” papers detailing research contributions to model-driven development of digital twins.
-	Short papers (5 pages): These are forward-looking papers about ideas that will interest the workshop attendees but which are not currently at an advanced level of research. These might be about new research avenues, research statements or positions, or about integrating existing research ideas, or technologies.
-	Tool demonstration papers (5 pages): These are papers which focus on the tooling aspects. A good tool paper focuses on practical insights that are likely to be useful to other implementers or users of digital twins in the future. Any of the aforementioned topics of interest are appropriate areas for tool demonstrations. Submissions must not exceed 5 pages. They may optionally come with an appendix with a demo outline / screenshots and/or a short video/screencast illustrating the tool.
-	Exemplar papers (5 pages): These are implementations or detailed specifications of digital twins that pose and highlight fundamental or characteristic challenges for the modelling community. Submissions must not exceed 5 pages. They may optionally come with an appendix with further materials, or a short video/screencast illustrating the exemplar.

Submissions must adhere to the IEEE formatting instructions, which can be found at: [IEEE - Manuscript Templates for Conference Proceedings](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html), and must be submitted [via EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=moddit23).

Submissions that do not adhere to the above limits or that violate the formatting guidelines will be desk-rejected without review. Accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings published of MODELS. Selected papers from the workshop will be invited to revise and submit extended versions of the papers for publication in a well-known journal.

## Important Dates

- Abstract submission deadline: Monday July 10th, 2023
- Paper submission deadline: Monday July 17h, 2023
- Notification of acceptance: Tuesday August 15th, 2023
- Camera ready submission deadline: Tuesday August 22nd, 2023
- Workshop: to be decided, between Sunday October 1st and Tuesday October 3rd, 2023

## Keynotes

We are pleased to announce that [Dr. Judith Michael](https://judithmichael.github.io) (RWTH Aachen University, Germany) will give a keynote talk:

**Unlocking Potential: Rocking the Sustainable Future with Digital Twins**

As we as humans and our activities in practice and research have profound impacts on the world, there has never been a more urgent need to address sustainability and its global challenges. A broad range of modeling and, in particular, domain-specific modeling techniques in combination with digital twins are currently being crystallized as a possible solution to address some of these challenges. In this keynote, we focus primarily on 2 perspectives: How can our research contribute to the sustainable development of digital twins, and how can we use digital twins to assess the sustainability of complex, software-intensive systems. Sustainability challenges are multi-faceted, forcing us to form alliances with researchers from other fields. As such, we can comprehensively explore economic, environmental and social sustainability and their balance at different scales to positively impact the future of our world.
